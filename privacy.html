            Collecting Personal Information
        </h1>
        <p>
            We're dedicated to providing you a great experience while keeping 
            your personal information safe and secure. When you use FYZO, we may 
            collect information such as your name, email address, and other personal 
            details that you provide to us. We may also automatically collect 
            from your device: language settings, IP address, time zone, type and 
            model of a device, device settings, operating system, Internet service 
            provider, mobile carrier, hardware ID, Facebook ID, and some other unique 
            identifiers (such as IDFA and AAID). We need this data to provide our 
            services, analyze how our customers use the app, to serve ads. For 
            improving the app and attracting users, we may use third party solutions. 
            As a result, we may process data using solutions developed by Amplitude, 
            Facebook, Firebase, Google, Apple, Appsflyer, Crashlytics. Therefore, 
            some of the data is stored and processed on servers of such third parties. 
            This enables us to (1) analyze different interactions (how often users 
            make subscriptions, the average weight and height of our users, how many 
            users chose a particular area for improvement); (2) serve ads (and are 
            able to show them only to a particular group of users, for example, to 
            subscribers). Consequently, we, in particular, better understand in what 
            of our features and content you see the most value and are able to focus 
            on them to enhance your experience and increase the quality of our products.
        </p>
        <p>
            We and our partners, may use your personal data to tailor ads and possibly 
            even show them to you at the relevant time. For example, if you have installed 
            our App, you might see ads of our products, for example, in your Facebook’s feed. 
            We do not use health, motion, and fitness information gained through Apple 
            Health Kit or Google Fit to personalize our ads.

            We use Facebook Ads Manager together with Facebook Custom Audience, which allows us to 
            choose audiences that will see our ads on Facebook or other Facebook’s 
            products (for example, Instagram). Through Facebook Custom Audience we may create a list 
            of users with certain sets of data, such as an IDFA, choose users that have completed 
            certain actions in the App (for example, installed it). As a result, we may ask Facebook 
            to show some ads to a particular list of users. As a result, more of our ads may show up 
            while you are using Facebook or other Facebook’s products (for example, Instagram). You 
            may learn how to opt out of advertising provided to you through Facebook Custom Audience 
            here. Facebook also allows its users to influence the types of ads they see on Facebook. 
            To find how to control the ads you see on Facebook, please go here or adjust your ads 
            settings on Facebook.

            Google Ads is an ad delivery service provided by Google that can deliver ads to users. 
            In particular, Google allows us to tailor the ads in a way that they will appear, for example, 
            only to users that have conducted certain actions with our App (for example, show our ads to 
            users who have purchased a subscription). Some other examples of events that may be used for 
            tailoring ads include, in particular, installing our App, finishing a workout program. Google 
            allows its users to opt out of Google’s personalized ads and to prevent their data from being 
            used by Google Analytics.
